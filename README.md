# growww :sappling:

*growww* is a website built by [Black Cat Studio](https://blkcatstudio.com) for a fictional plant shop, to showcase the wonderful combination of [Svelte/ Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev/) & [Sanity CMS](https://www.sanity.io/). Sanity is configured to allow the shop owner to upload new plants they're added to there inventory & toggle whether the plants show on the front end of the website to reflect the current inventory of the shop.
